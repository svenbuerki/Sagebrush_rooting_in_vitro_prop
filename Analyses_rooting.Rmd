# Overview of methodology 

In this document, we are presenting the code associated to the analyses performed on tissue culture data (rooting and calli) generated from shoot tips of diploid *Artemisia tridentata* subsp. *tridentata* (2n=2x=18). 

The analyses were conducted in four steps:

- **Step 1:** Import and tidy raw data.
- **Step 2:** Preliminary analyses on the effect of growth regulators on rooting and calli development on shoot tips.
- **Step 3:** Comparative analyses on tissue culture data. This was done following a two-tier approach:
  + Statistical analyses (ANOVAs and Tukey tests with p-value <= 0.01).
  + Clustering analyses.
- **Step 4:** *In vitro* growth of plantules. 
  + Assessing the effect of growth regulators and rooting clusters on plantule survival and growth rates.


# Step 1: Import and tidy raw data

The objective of this section is to merge data on rooting and calli stored in spreadsheets (in `csv` format). Each spreadsheet corresponds to a block and the code below collate these into one `data.frame` for downstream analyses. 

The final dataset (`MERGE` object) contains the following columns (see Table \@ref(tab:tidy) for more details on sampling):

- `Block`: 1 to 5.
- `Treatment`: `Control` (= no growth regulator), `IBA_1`, `IBA_05`, `NAA_1`, `NAA_05`. Here `1` and `05` represent concentrations of the two growth regulators (IBA and NAA) at 1 and 0.5 mg/l. 
- `Replicate`: 1 to 3.
- `Genotype`: `G1` and `G2`.
- Individual: `Individual` and `IndGeno`. The latter variable combines data on genotype and individual and will be used throughout the document.
- `Callus`: Binary (1/0).
- Root: `Root` with number of roots per shoot tip and `RootBin` with binary (1/0) data. Although statistical analyses were also performed on binary data, analyses are mainly based on the quantitative variable (= `Root`).

## Code to import and tidy raw data

Raw data in `csv` format are stored in the `01_Raw_data` folder. The processed/tidy data are saved in `csv` format in the `02_Processed_data` folder. The `MERGE` object (in class `data.frame`) will be used for downstream analyses.

## Statistics on plant materials 

Table \@ref(tab:statssampling) provides a summary of plant materials included in this study. Overall, 45 individuals distributed into two genotypes (which were evenly sampled) were generated from seeds. For each individual, 15 shoot tips were produced and included into five treatments with three replicates (= 3 shoot tips/ind./treatment). Individuals were randomly allocated to 5 blocks containing 9 individual each. The code below generates Table \@ref(tab:statssampling).

### Code to generate Table \@ref(tab:statssampling)

```{r statssampling, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
#Create and populate table to summarize sampling (Table 1)
samp_mat <- matrix(ncol=9, nrow=1)
colnames(samp_mat) <- c("N. block", "N. treatments", "Treatments", "N. replicates", "N. genotypes", 
                        "N. individuals", "N. ind. per genotype", "Ind. G1", "Ind. G2")

#N block
samp_mat[,1] <- length(unique(MERGE$Block))

# Step 2: Preliminary analyses on the effect of growth regulators on rooting and calli development on shoot tips

Preliminary data summarizing results of our experiments are provided here to assess the effect of growth regulators on *in vitro* rooting of *Artemisia tridentata*. During the course of the experiment, calli developed on a large proportion of shoot tips, which was unexpected based on preliminary data. We are therefore summarizing these data here by treatment and will devote a portion of the analyses to investigate whether callus development was associated to treatments and whether those inhibited or promoted rooting.

## Effect of growth regulators on *in vitro* rooting of *Artemisia tridentata*

The effect of growth regulators is provided in Table \@ref(tab:growthbyregulator) and compared to the control treatment (= no growth regulator). These data show a very high level of variation in rooting (see column `Av. No. roots`). We are hypothesizing that this trend is caused by an individual effect. To test this hypothesis we will conduct comparative analyses (see **Step 4**) to sort individuals based on their rooting abilities. Finally, the effect of growth regulators on *in vitro* rooting will be compared within each cluster.  

### Code to generate Table \@ref(tab:growthbyregulator)

```{r growthbyregulator, echo=T, eval=T}
#Matrix summarizing effect of growth regulators on rooting
RootingStatbyTreat <- matrix(ncol=4, nrow=5)
colnames(RootingStatbyTreat) <- c("Growth regulator", "Concentration (mg/l)", "Response (%)", "Av. No. of roots")
rownames(RootingStatbyTreat) <- sort(unique(MERGE$Treatment))

#Convert to dataframe
RootingStatbyTreat <- as.data.frame(RootingStatbyTreat)

#Populate matrix
RootingStatbyTreat$`Growth regulator` <- sapply(strsplit(rownames(RootingStatbyTreat), split="_"),"[[",1)
RootingStatbyTreat$`Concentration (mg/l)` <- c("-", sapply(strsplit(rownames(RootingStatbyTreat)[2:nrow(RootingStatbyTreat)], split="_"),"[[",2))

#Infer Response and mean no roots
for(i in 1:nrow(RootingStatbyTreat)){
  foo <- subset(MERGE, MERGE$Treatment == rownames(RootingStatbyTreat)[i])
  RootingStatbyTreat$`Response (%)`[i] <- round(100*(mean(foo$RootBin)),2)
  RootingStatbyTreat$`Av. No. of roots`[i] <- paste(round(mean(foo$Root),2), "+/-", round(sd(foo$Root),2), sep=" ")
}


#Plot table
knitr::kable(RootingStatbyTreat, row.names=F, caption = "Effect of growth regulators on in vitro rooting for shoot tips of diploid Artemisia tridentata subsp. tridentata. Response: mean of the three replicates; Av. No. of roots (Average number of roots per shoot tip): mean +/- standard deviation.")
```

## Effect of growth regulators on *in vitro* callus development in *Artemisia tridentata*

The effect of growth regulators on calli development is provided in Table \@ref(tab:growthbyregulatorcallus) and compared to the control treatment (= no growth regulator). These data show contrasting calli development between the control and treatments including growth hormones. Control shoot tips had limited calli development, whereas responses for those undergoing treatments were very high (>70%; Table \@ref(tab:growthbyregulatorcallus)).

### Code to generate Table \@ref(tab:growthbyregulatorcallus)

```{r growthbyregulatorcallus, echo=T, eval=T}
#Matrix summarizing effect of growth regulators on rooting
CallusStatbyTreat <- matrix(ncol=3, nrow=5)
colnames(CallusStatbyTreat) <- c("Growth regulator", "Concentration (mg/l)", "Response (%)")
rownames(CallusStatbyTreat) <- sort(unique(MERGE$Treatment))

#Convert to dataframe
CallusStatbyTreat <- as.data.frame(CallusStatbyTreat)

#Populate matrix
CallusStatbyTreat$`Growth regulator` <- sapply(strsplit(rownames(CallusStatbyTreat), split="_"),"[[",1)
CallusStatbyTreat$`Concentration (mg/l)` <- c("-", sapply(strsplit(rownames(CallusStatbyTreat)[2:nrow(CallusStatbyTreat)], split="_"),"[[",2))

#Infer Response and mean no roots
for(i in 1:nrow(CallusStatbyTreat)){
  foo <- subset(MERGE, MERGE$Treatment == rownames(CallusStatbyTreat)[i])
  CallusStatbyTreat$`Response (%)`[i] <- round(100*mean(foo$Callus),2)
}


#Plot table
knitr::kable(CallusStatbyTreat, row.names=F, caption = "Effect of growth regulators on in vitro calli development on shoot tips of diploid Artemisia tridentata subsp. tridentata. Response: mean of the three replicates.")
```


# Step 3: Comparative analyses on tissue culture data

The input variables for these analyses are stored in `MERGE` and results will be saved in `rds` format in `02_Processed_data/rds_tables`.

## Statistical analyses for rooting data

Please find below the analyses conducted on quantitative rooting data. The same analyses were performed on the binary data and are found in [Appendix 4].

### ANOVA with model based on number of roots per shoot tip

Our overall model is `root ~ treatment`, but we are also testing whether there is a `block`, `genotype` and `individual` effect in explaining rooting data. This leads to the following model:

```
aov(Root ~ Treatment * Block * Genotype * Individual)
```

To be considered significant, a variable as to have a p-value <= 0.01.

#### Code for ANOVA analysis

```{r ANOVAroot, echo=T, eval=T}
###~~~
#Define model and run analysis
###~~~
anovaOUT<- aov(Root ~ Treatment * Block * Genotype * IndGeno, data = MERGE)


# Summary of ANOVA
summary(anovaOUT)

#as.data.frame.matrix(x[[1]][1:5])

# Save analysis
saveRDS(anovaOUT,"02_Processed_data/rds_tables/anova.rds")
```

In our model, significant variables (`**` or `***`) are:

- Treatment (`***`)
- Individual (here represented by `IndGeno`) (`***`)
- Treatment:Block (`***`)
- Treatment:Individual (`**`) 

We are hypothesizing that the latter two variables result from to the high individual effect since individuals were randomly assigned to blocks. 

### Tukey tests on significant variables from ANOVA based on number of roots per shoot tip

The code to perform the Tukey tests on significant variables from the ANOVA analysis is presented below.

```{r tukeyroot, echo=T, eval=T}
###~~~
#Tukey tests on significant variables from ANOVA
###~~~

# Object with significant variables
significant_vars <- c("Treatment", "IndGeno", "Treatment:IndGeno", "Treatment:Block")

# Run Tukey tests
anovaOUT_tukey <- TukeyHSD(anovaOUT, significant_vars)

# Save analysis
saveRDS(anovaOUT_tukey,"02_Processed_data/rds_tables/anova_tukey.rds")
```

#### Investigate treatment effect on rooting data

Inspect Tukey tests output to identify treatment(s) best performing for initiating roots.

```{r tukeyroot2, echo=T, eval=T}
###~~~
#What treatment(s) are significantly increasing rooting? (**: 0.01)
###~~~
treatcomp <- anovaOUT_tukey$Treatment[which(as.numeric(anovaOUT_tukey$Treatment[,4]) <= 0.01),]

#Plot table
knitr::kable(treatcomp, caption = "Results of Tukey tests comparing treatments (with pval: <=0.01).")
```

Table \@ref(tab:tukeyroot2) allows ranking treatments as follows (from worst to best):

 - (c) `Control` (is outperformed by all treatments) (`***`)
 - (b) `NAA_1` and `NAA_05`
 - (a) `IBA_1`, `IBA_05` (although `IBA_1` outperforms `IBA_05` with a pval <= 0.05)

#### Boxplot of rooting by treatment

To support further visual comparison of rooting by treatment, a boxplot was inferred based on the merged dataset (`MERGE`). Figure \@ref(fig:boxplot1) supports ranking from the Tukey analysis (Table \@ref(tab:tukeyroot) and would suggest that `IBA_1` is the most efficient treatment to initiate rooting in sagebrush with a median value of 1 root per tip (whereas other treatments have their median at 0).

```{r boxplot, echo=T, eval=F}
###~~~
#Boxplot comparing rooting per treatment
###~~~
boxplot(MERGE$Root ~ MERGE$Treatment, xlab = "Treatment", ylab = "Number of roots per tip", frame = "none", ylim=c(0,12.5))

# Add ranking based on Tukey tests
text(x=c(1,2,3,4,5), y=rep(12.5,5), c("c","a","a",'b','b'))
```
```{r boxplot1, echo=F, eval=T, fig.cap="Boxplot comparing number of roots per shoot tip of diploid Artemisia tridentata subsp. tridentata sorted by treatment. Rankings are based on Tukey tests using letters (see text for more details).", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("03_Figures_report/Fig_1_Rooting_results.png")
```

#### Investigate individual effect on rooting data

Here, we are using the results of ANOVA (`anovaOUT`) and Tukey tests on the individual variable to identify individuals which are significantly outperforming the other individuals. To qualify as a top performer, an individual has to outperform >=20% of individuals based on a p-value <= 0.01. 

Table \@ref(tab:tukeyind) shows the list of top performers independently of treatment conditions. Notice that the three individuals all belong to the G2 genotype. Those individuals will be referred to as P1 to P3 to reflect their top rooting performance. P1 and P2 are the only individuals recovered by the Tukey tests performed on binary rooting data (see Table \@ref(tab:tukeyindbin)). 

```{r tukeyind, echo=T, eval=T}
###~~~
#Tukey test: Individual effect
###~~~

# Individual effect
IndTukey <- anovaOUT_tukey$IndGeno[which(as.numeric(anovaOUT_tukey$IndGeno[,4]) <= 0.01),]

# What are the top performers (= most efficient at producing roots)?
IndTukeyOut <- IndTukey[which(IndTukey[,1] > 0),]

# Extract best performing ind (first in rownames of comparison)
P1 <- sapply(strsplit(rownames(IndTukey), split='-'), "[[",1)

# Percentage of individuals that are outperformed by P1
TopInd <- 100*(sort(table(P1), decreasing=T)/length(unique(MERGE$IndGeno)))

# Select only ind that are outperforming at least 20% of individuals 
TopInd <- TopInd[which(TopInd >= 20)]

TopInd <- as.matrix(round(TopInd, 1))
colnames(TopInd) <- c("Percentage of individuals outperformed")

# Plot table
knitr::kable(TopInd, caption = "List of individual that are outperforming at least 20% of individuals (based on Tukey tests on Individual variable with a pval: 0.01).")
```

## Clustering analysis of number of roots per shoot tip

A clustering analysis was used to compare rooting performance between individuals of Basin Big sagebrush based on an euclidean distance (using `Root` variable). This analysis sorted individuals into rooting clusters based on their abilities to initiate rooting (which is also shown by the heatmap). Finally, to performer individuals (P1 to P3) identified by the statistical analyses are also represented on the graph. The code used to produce these analyses is available below. The analysis clearly distinguished three clusters (of even number of individuals; see Table \@ref(tab:tablegroups)) based on individual rooting performances (Figure \@ref(fig:heatmap2)):

- Black cluster: No to very little rooting.
- Pink cluster: Some rooting observed.
- Blue cluster: Most individuals are exhibiting high rooting capacity and the top three performers belong to this cluster. It is worth noting that P2 has only two tips (out of 15) that did not produce roots.

### Code to produce clustering analysis on rooting data

```{r heatmap1, echo=T, eval=F}
###~~
#Clustering analysis on rooting data
###~~~
# Create our own color palette from green to red for heatmap
my_palette <- colorRampPalette(c("green", "yellow", "red"))(n = 299)

# Input data for clustering and heatmap
mat_data <- table(MERGE$IndGeno, MERGE$Root)

# Load file with color of individuals (which group based on clusters they belong to)
colInd <- read.csv("02_Processed_data/Rooting_clusters_individuals.csv")

# Annotate best perfoming individuals (based on Tukey test) and add P1, P2, P3
toAdd <- which(rownames(mat_data) %in% names(TopInd))
rownames(mat_data)[toAdd] <- paste0(rownames(mat_data)[toAdd], c(" (P1)", " (P2)", " (P3)"))

# Perform clustering/heatmap and draw plot
heatmap.2(mat_data,
          cellnote = mat_data, # same data set for cell labels
          main = "", # heat map title

          notecex = .8, # cex of numbers in cells
          density.info="none",  # turns off density plot inside color legend
          trace="none",         # turns off trace lines inside the heat map
          xlab = 'N. roots per tip (1 ind. has 15 tips)', #Label of x axis
          cexRow = .8, # cex of rows (= samples ID)
          margins =c(4,9),     # widens margins around plot
          col=my_palette,       # use on color palette defined earlier
          #breaks=col_breaks,    # enable color transition at specified limits
          dendrogram="row", # only draw a row dendrogram
          key=F,
          keysize = 0.4,
          RowSideColors = as.vector(colInd$Group),
          Colv="NA") # turn off column clustering
```

```{r heatmap2, echo=F, eval=T, fig.cap="Heatmap comparing calli production of shoot tips of diploid Artemisia tridentata subsp. tridentata showing three clusters, which are not identical to those inferred with rooting data. The position of top performers as identified by the Tukey tests on rooting data is also displayed.", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("03_Figures_report/Fig_2_Heatmap_compare_ind_rooting.png")
```

### Code to produce Table \@ref(tab:tablegroups)

The number of individual per rooting clusters inferred from the clustering analysis is displayed in Table \@ref(tab:tablegroups). The code to generate this table is found below.

```{r tablegroups, echo=T, eval=T}
###~~~
#Produce pivot table with number of individual per group and genotype composition
###~~~
# Load file with color of individuals (which group based on clusters they belong to)
colInd <- read.csv("02_Processed_data/Rooting_clusters_individuals.csv")

# colInd add Genotypes
colInd$Genotype <- sapply(strsplit(as.vector(colInd$Individual), split="_"), "[[", 1)
tabGroup <- table(colInd$Group, colInd$Genotype)
tabGroup <- tabGroup[c(1,3,2),]
tabGroup <- as.data.frame.matrix(tabGroup)
tabGroup$TOT <- rowSums(tabGroup)

# Plot table
knitr::kable(tabGroup, row.names=T, caption = "Table summarizing composition of clusters based on rooting data.")
```

### Effect of growth regulators on *in vitro* rooting sorted by clusters

Table \@ref(tab:growthbyregulatorcluster) shows that IBA at both concentrations seem to have a significant effect on rooting for individuals belonging to the blue cluster (Figure \@ref(fig:heatmap2)). Responses are very high (both at 87.18%) and the number of roots per tip are 2.97 +/- 2.25 for IBA 0.5 and 3.59 +/- 3.41 for IBA 1 (Table \@ref(tab:growthbyregulatorcluster)).

```{r growthbyregulatorcluster, echo=T, eval=T}
#Load file with color of individuals (which group based on clusters they belong to)
colInd <- read.csv("02_Processed_data/Rooting_clusters_individuals.csv")
treat <- sort(unique(MERGE$Treatment))

#Matrix summarizing effect of growth regulators on rooting
RootingStatbyTreatC <- matrix(ncol=6, nrow=15)
colnames(RootingStatbyTreatC) <- c("Cluster","Growth regulator", "Concentration (mg/l)", "Response (%)", "Av. No. of roots", "Treatment")

#Add col in MERGE with cluster
MERGE$ClusterRoot <- colInd$Group[match(MERGE$IndGeno, colInd$Individual)]

#Convert to dataframe
RootingStatbyTreatC <- as.data.frame(RootingStatbyTreatC)

#Populate matrix
RootingStatbyTreatC$Cluster <- sort(rep(sort(unique(MERGE$ClusterRoot)),5))
RootingStatbyTreatC$`Growth regulator` <- rep(sapply(strsplit(treat, split="_"),"[[",1),3)
RootingStatbyTreatC$`Concentration (mg/l)` <- rep(c("-", sapply(strsplit(treat[2:length(treat)], split="_"),"[[",2)),3)
RootingStatbyTreatC$Treatment <- rep(treat, 3)

#Infer Response and mean no roots
for(i in 1:nrow(RootingStatbyTreatC)){
  foo <- subset(MERGE, MERGE$Treatment == RootingStatbyTreatC$Treatment[i] & MERGE$ClusterRoot == RootingStatbyTreatC$Cluster[i])
  RootingStatbyTreatC$`Response (%)`[i] <- round(100*(mean(foo$RootBin)),2)
  RootingStatbyTreatC$`Av. No. of roots`[i] <- paste(round(mean(foo$Root),2), "+/-", round(sd(foo$Root),2), sep=" ")
}


#Plot table
knitr::kable(RootingStatbyTreatC[,1:5], row.names=F, caption = "Effect of growth regulator on in vitro rooting of Artemisia tridentata sorted by cluster. Response: mean of the three replicates; Av. No. of roots: mean +/- standard deviation.")
```

This will be investigated by looking at top performer individuals identified by i) ANOVA analyses and ii) clustering analysis.

## Statistical analysis focusing on individuals in the blue rooting cluster

Here, we will apply ANOVA followed by Tukey tests to test whether treatments identified with all individuals are still significantly increasing rooting for individuals in the blue rooting cluster. This is done by applying the code provided below:

### ANOVA with model using rooting data applied to individuals in the blue cluster

The code provided below starts by sub-setting `MERGE` to only include individuals from the blue cluster. Then, the  ANOVA model is built and applied to the `Root` data.

```{r statsClust, echo=T, eval=T}
###~~~
#Subset MERGE dataset to only include ind. from blue cluster
###~~~

These analyses supported significant effects for `Treatment` (`***`) and `IndGeno` (`***`).

### Tukey tests on significant variables from ANOVA based on number of roots per shoot tip for blue cluster

Tukey tests on significant variables are conducted with the code below and results are provided in Tables \@ref(tab:tukeytopClust2) and \@ref(tab:tukeytopClustind). `Control` is outperformed by treatments with growth regulators, with the exception of `NAA_05`. `IBA_1` outperforms `NAA_05`, but it is not significantly better than `NAA_1` and `IBA_05`.

```{r tukeytopClust, echo=T, eval=T}
###~~~
#Tukey tests
###~~~
# Vector with significant variables
significant_vars <- c("Treatment", "IndGeno")

# Perform Tukey tests
anovaOUT_tukeyClust <- TukeyHSD(anovaOUTClust, significant_vars)

# Save analysis
saveRDS(anovaOUT_tukeyClust,"02_Processed_data/rds_tables/TukeyRootClust.rds")
```

#### Investigate treatment effect

```{r tukeytopClust2, echo=T, eval=T}
###~~~
#Investigate treatment effect (***)
###~~~
TreatTukey2Clust <- anovaOUT_tukeyClust$Treatment[which(as.numeric(anovaOUT_tukeyClust$Treatment[,4]) <= 0.01),]

#Plot table
knitr::kable(TreatTukey2Clust, caption = "Results of the Tukey tests focusing on treatment effect for individuals in blue cluster.")
```

#### Investigate individual effect

```{r tukeytopClustind, echo=T, eval=T}
#Investigate individual effect (***)
TreatTukey2Clustind <- anovaOUT_tukeyClust$IndGeno[which(as.numeric(anovaOUT_tukeyClust$IndGeno[,4]) <= 0.01),]

# What are the top performers (= most efficient at producing roots)?
IndTukeyOut <- TreatTukey2Clustind[which(TreatTukey2Clustind[,1] > 0),]

# Extract best performing ind (first in rownames of comparison)
P1 <- sapply(strsplit(rownames(IndTukeyOut), split='-'), "[[",1)

# Percentage of individuals that are outperformed by P1
TopInd <- 100*(sort(table(P1), decreasing=T)/length(unique(BestClust$IndGeno)))

# Select only ind that are outperforming at least 20% of individuals 
TopInd <- TopInd[which(TopInd >= 20)]

TopInd <- as.matrix(round(TopInd, 1))
colnames(TopInd) <- c("Percentage of individuals outperformed")

# Plot table
knitr::kable(TopInd, caption = "List of individual that are outperforming at least 20% of individuals in the blue rooting cluster (based on Tukey tests on Individual variable with a pval: 0.01).")
```

## Statistical analyses for calli data 

Table \@ref(tab:growthbyregulatorcallus) demonstrated that >70% of shoot tips undergoing growth regulator treatments developed calli, whereas those in the control treatment had very limited calli development (< 3%). This preliminary result strongly suggested that calli was induced by growth regulators (in addition to the age of plants resulting in production of endogenous auxin and cytokinin) and we will be testing this hypothesis using ANOVAs.

### ANOVA with model based on calli data 

The model is the same as with roots and the code is available below.

```{r anovacallus, echo=T, eval=T}
###~~~
#ANOVA with model for calli data
###~~~

# Perform ANOVA using same model as root
anovaCallus <- aov(Callus ~ Treatment * Block * Genotype * IndGeno, data = MERGE)

# Summary
summary(anovaCallus)

# Save analysis
saveRDS(anovaCallus,"02_Processed_data/rds_tables/anovaCallus.rds")
```

These results are identical to the rooting analyses and support `Treatment` and `Individual` (here reflected by `IndGeno`) effects.

### Tukey tests on significant variables from ANOVA based on calli data

The code to perform the Tukey tests on significant variables is available below.

```{r tukeycallianalysis, echo=T, eval=T}
###~~~
#Tukey tests on significant variables
###~~~

# Vector with significant variables
significant_vars <- c("Treatment", "IndGeno")

# Run Tukey tests
anovaCallus_tukey2 <- TukeyHSD(anovaCallus, significant_vars)

# Save analysis
saveRDS(anovaCallus_tukey2,"02_Processed_data/rds_tables/TukeyCallus.rds")
```

#### Investigate treatment effect

Table \@ref(tab:tukeycalli) summarizes the Tukey tests focusing on treatment effect. These analyses are not entirely conclusive, but they demonstrate that:

- (c) Control is outperformed by all treatments (`***`).
- (b) No significant differences between IBA_1, NAA_05.
- (a) NAA_1 outperforms IBA_05.


```{r tukeycalli, echo=T, eval=T}

tabIndNeg <- table(CallusIndNeg)

#Percentage of individuals that are outperformed by tabIndNeg
TopIndNeg <- 100*(sort(tabIndNeg, decreasing=T)/length(unique(MERGE$IndGeno)))

#Select only ind that are outperforming at least 20% of individuals 
TopInd <- TopIndNeg[which(TopIndNeg >= 20)]

TopInd <- as.matrix(round(TopInd, 1))
colnames(TopInd) <- c("Percentage of individuals outperformed")

#Plot table
knitr::kable(TopInd, caption = "Individuals that are significantly NOT producing calli independently of treatment.")
```

### Clustering analysis of calli data

The code to produce the clustering analysis based on `Callus` data and associated heatmap is provided below and Figure \@ref(fig:heatmapplot) shows results of the analysis. Outcomes of this analysis are:

- Three clusters based on calli production:
  + Bottom cluster has individuals with no to very limited calli production.
  + Intermediate cluster has individuals with 50/50 calli production.
  + Top cluster has individuals with individuals producing calli.
- Clusters from the rooting analysis are not recovered here (each calli cluster are composed by a mixture of clusters from the rooting analysis). This suggests that calli production do not inhibit rooting.
- To performer individuals are shared between the intermediate and top clusters (supporting previous statement).

### Effect of growth regulators on *in vitro* calli production in *Artemisia tridentata* sorted by rooting clusters

## Statistical analyses

Here, we will use ANOVAs followed by Tukey tests to test whether treatment, individual, rooting cluster or number of roots per shoot tip predicted survival and heights of plantlets after 5-weeks of culture.

### Treatment, individual, cluster effects on plantlet survival

These analyses are done on data in `survheig`, more specifically on `survheig$X5_w_survival` and extracting treatments from `survheig$Treatment` (which contains block, treatment and replicate information in one object).

```{r}
####~~~~
#Infer treatment types recieved by plantles
###~~~
survheig$Treat <- paste(sapply(strsplit(as.vector(survheig$Treatment), split="_"), "[[", c(2)), sapply(strsplit(as.vector(survheig$Treatment), split="_"), "[[", c(3)), sep="_")
survheig$Treat[grep("Control_", survheig$Treat)] <- "Control"

###~~~
#Turn survival into a binary data (sickly plantlets have a score of 0.5, but will be changed to 1)
###~~~
survheig$X5_w_survival[which(survheig$X5_w_survival == 0.5)] <- 1

###~~~~
#Define ANOVA model and run analysis
###~~~
anovaOUTsurv<- aov(X5_w_survival ~ Treat * SeedID * Cluster, data = survheig)


# Summary of ANOVA
summary(anovaOUTsurv)

# The lack of treatment effect is confirmed by this table showing that there is a 50/50 chance of survival across treatments
table(survheig$X5_w_survival, survheig$Treat)
```

The ANOVA shows that there is no treatment effect on survival, but rather that survival is again predicted by individual effect (p-value <= 0.001). When Tukey tests are conducted on individual data and with a p-value of 0.01, only one individual (`G2_b8_1`) is exhibiting significantly higher death rates than 2 other individuals. Overall, this results means that at this stage, individuals are all performing equally (with the exception of one which has a very high death rate). 

```{r tukeysurv, echo=T, eval=T}
###~~~
#Tukey tests on significant variables
###~~~

# Vector with significant variables (only one here)
significant_vars <- c("SeedID")

# Run Tukey tests
anovaOUTsurv_tukey <- TukeyHSD(anovaOUTsurv, significant_vars)

# Save analysis
saveRDS(anovaOUTsurv_tukey,"02_Processed_data/rds_tables/TukeySurv.rds")

#Investigate individual effect (***)
IndTukeySurv <- anovaOUTsurv_tukey$SeedID[which(as.numeric(anovaOUTsurv_tukey$SeedID[,4]) <= 0.01),]

## This analysis shows that ind G2_b8_1 has significantly higher death rate than two other individuals
print(IndTukeySurv)
```

### Effect of number of roots, individual or rooting clusters on plantlet heights

Here, we will only work on alive plantlets (`survheig$X5_w_survival` == 1) and conduct an ANOVA followed by Tukey tests as follows:

```{r anovaroot, echo=T, eval=T}
###~~~
#Subset surveigh to include only alive plantlets after 5 weeks
###~~~

#All plantlets surviving after 5 weeks of culture 
subSurvHeigh <- subset(survheig, survheig$X5_w_survival != "0")

###~~~
#Fetch number of roots per shoot tip
###~~~

#Fetch no. roots of shoot tips in subSurvHeigh by querying MERGE
MERGE$BlockTreatRep <- paste(MERGE$Block, MERGE$Treatment, MERGE$Replicate, sep="_")

#Loop to get N roots
subSurvHeigh$Root <- "NULL"
for(i in 1:nrow(subSurvHeigh)){
  tmp <- subset(MERGE, MERGE$IndGeno == subSurvHeigh$SeedID[i] & MERGE$BlockTreatRep == subSurvHeigh$Treatment[i])
  subSurvHeigh$Root[i] <- tmp$Root
}

#subSurvHeigh <- subSurvHeigh[-which(subSurvHeigh$Root == 0),]
###~~~
#Define ANOVA model and run analysis
###~~~
#Since it seemed that treatment had an effect
anovaOUTRoot <- aov(X5_w_height ~ Cluster * SeedID * Root, data = subSurvHeigh)


# Summary of ANOVA
summary(anovaOUTRoot)

```

The Tukey tests show that individuals in the blue rooting cluster are significantly taller than those in the pink cluster (black is not shown different than blue, but it could be due to small sampling size of this cluster). Finally, `G2_b27_1` is significantly taller than 13.88% of the individuals included in this experiment. This individual was identified as a top 3 performer!  

```{r tukeyheight, echo=T, eval=T}
###~~~

# What are the top cluster(s) (= most efficient at growing fast)?
#ClusterTukeyHeightTop <- ClustTukeyHeight[which(ClustTukeyHeight[,1] > 0),]

# Extract best performing ind (first in rownames of comparison)
P1growth <- sapply(strsplit(rownames(IndTukeyHeightTop), split='-'), "[[",1)

# Percentage of individuals that are outperformed by P1
TopIndgrowth <- 100*(sort(table(P1growth), decreasing=T)/length(unique(subSurvHeigh$SeedID)))

## This analysis shows that G2_b27_1 grows significantly faster than 14.28% of the individuals in this experiment
print(TopIndgrowth)
```


## Boxplot of plantlet heights for individuals in blue rooting cluster

Figure \@ref(fig:boxplotheightblue) shows the distribution of plantlets heights after five weeks of culture for individuals belonging to the blue rooting cluster of diploid *Artemisia tridentata* subsp. *tridentata*. As predicted by the statistical analyses on plantlet heights, `G2_b7_1` is the individual with the fastest growth in our experiment. 

```{r boxplotheightblue, echo=T, eval=T, fig.cap="Boxplot showing plantlets heights after five weeks of culture for individuals belonging to the blue rooting cluster of diploid Artemisia tridentata subsp. tridentata. The n indicates the number of plantlets cultured for each individual."}

## ANOVAs with model on binary rooting data

Our overall model is `root ~ treatment` But we are also testing if there is a `Block`, `Genotype` and `IndGeno` (= individual) effect in rooting. This leads to this model:

```
aov(Root ~ Treatment * Block * Genotype * Individual)
```

```{r ANOVArootbin, echo=T, eval=T}
###~~~
#ANOVA model and run
###~~~

# Define model and run analysis
anovaOUTbin <- aov(RootBin ~ Treatment * Block * Genotype * IndGeno, data = MERGE)

# Summary
summary(anovaOUTbin)

# Save analysis
saveRDS(anovaOUT,"02_Processed_data/rds_tables/anovabin.rds")
```

In our model, significant variables (`**` or `***`) are:

- Treatment (`***`)
- Individual (here represented by `IndGeno`) (`***`)
- Block (`***`)
- Treatment:Block (`**`)

The latter two variables are most likely due to the high individual effect (indeed, individuals in blocks were randomly assigned; see Q2 for more details). 

## Tukey tests on significant variables

### Treatment effects on rooting performance

Perform the Tukey test to identify treatment(s) best performing for initiating roots.

```{r tukeyrootbin, echo=T, eval=T}
###~~~
#Tukey tests on significant variables
###~~~
# Vector with significant variables
significant_vars <- c("Treatment", "IndGeno", "Block", "Treatment:Block")

# Run analysis
anovaOUT_tukeybin <- TukeyHSD(anovaOUTbin, significant_vars)

# Save analysis
saveRDS(anovaOUT_tukey,"02_Processed_data/rds_tables/anova_tukeybin.rds")

# What treatment(s) are significantly increasing rooting? (**: 0.01)
treatcompbin <- anovaOUT_tukeybin$Treatment[which(as.numeric(anovaOUT_tukeybin$Treatment[,4]) <= 0.01),]

# Plot table
knitr::kable(treatcompbin, caption = "Results of Tukey tests comparing treatments based on binary rooting data (with pval: <=0.01).")
```

Table \@ref(tab:tukeyrootbin) allows ranking treatments as follows (from worst to best):

 - (c) Control (outperformed by all treatments) (`***`)
 - (b) NAA_1 and NAA_05
 - (a) IBA_1, IBA_05 (although IBA_1 outperforms IBA_05 with a pval <= 0.05)

### Individual effect on rooting performance

Table \@ref(tab:tukeyindbin) shows the list of top performers individuals independently of treatment conditions. Notice that the two individuals all belong to genotype G2. Those two individuals were also identified by the previous analysis based on number of roots per tip.

```{r tukeyindbin, echo=T, eval=T}
#Tukey test: Individual effect

#Individual effect
IndTukeybin <- anovaOUT_tukeybin$IndGeno[which(as.numeric(anovaOUT_tukeybin$IndGeno[,4]) <= 0.01),]

#What are the individuals that are the most prolific at producing roots?
#Those should be prioritized for establishing lines
IndTukeyOutbin <- IndTukeybin[which(IndTukeybin[,1] > 0),]
#Extract best performing ind (first in rownames of comparison)
P1bin <- sapply(strsplit(rownames(IndTukeybin), split='-'), "[[",1)

#Percentage of individuals that are outperformed by P1
TopIndbin <- 100*(sort(table(P1bin), decreasing=T)/length(unique(MERGE$IndGeno)))

#Select only ind that are outperforming at least 20% of individuals 
TopIndbin <- TopIndbin[which(TopIndbin >= 20)]

TopIndbin <- as.matrix(round(TopIndbin, 1))
colnames(TopIndbin) <- c("Percentage of individuals outperformed")

#Plot table
knitr::kable(TopInd, caption = "List of individual that are outperforming at least 20% of individuals (based on Tukey tests on Individual variable with a pval: 0.01).")
```
