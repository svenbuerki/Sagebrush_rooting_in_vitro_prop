# Overview of project

This companion website to Martinez et al. provides the reproducible workflow integrating data, code, methods and results associated to this study aiming at developing an *in vitro* method of propagation using growth regulators for Basin Big sagebrush (*Artemisia tridentata* subsp. *tridentata*: 2n=2x=18) to support genome sequencing and GxE research.

The [data](https://github.com/svenbuerki/Sagebrush_rooting_in_vitro_prop), [protocols](protocols.html) and [reproducible workflow](Analyses_rooting.html) are available on this website. A map with locations where seeds from mother plants were collected by our colleagues at the US Forest Service is available [here](location_pop.html).
